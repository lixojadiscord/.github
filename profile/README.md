### Hi there 👋

- 🙋‍ ♀️We are the Development-Team from the Lixoja Bot and other Lixoja Projects - We publish code that has something to do with Discord most of the time. We are currently working on a Python wrapper for the Discord API.
We also have a **multifunctional** Discord bot, which includes for example voice activities (not all yet, because we first program lixojapy and then reprogram the bot to use the lixojapy library...), threads, moderation and much more!
- 🌈 You can give us suggestions at our repo under the tab "Pull Requests", you can report errors / bugs under the tab "Issues". On our Discord server you can also send suggestions (currently only for our bot) and also report bugs, and ask questions etc and chat in general.
- 👩‍💻 We are working on several projects, https://lixojapy.rtfd.io/ you can find the Lixojapy Docs (Not set up yet, but once the lib function is there it will be set up). We have another docs for our Discord bot, you can find it on our Discord server (It's not up to date, we will update it soon).
- 🍿 Um, snacks I think or something, pizza yes idk...
